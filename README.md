# Wait Up!

Check it out on mobile or tablet and add to homescreen: https://waitupgame.com

This React mobile/tablet web app is inspired by the native iOS and Android game, [_Heads Up!_][1]

## Introduction

I find the mobile game _"Heads Up!"_ to be really fun to play in group settings. There's just a couple of elements about the game that I, and other players, do not enjoy.

- Repeat cards in a session
- \$1.00 or more per deck
- No offline support
- Not very kid friendly
- Camera records during play
- Great to play while waiting in line at Disney theme parks but only one Disney deck.

#### Solutions:

- No more repeats per playing session
- 100% free
- Offline support after install
- Kid-friendly decks with images instead of text
- No camera recording
- 100% Disney themed

## How to Play

Almost exactly like the original:

- Choose a deck
- Place device on forehead and wait for game to start
- Tilt device down for correct, up for skip
- **Shake your device to exit the game at any time**
